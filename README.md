# Alpha_Edison_Challenge
Alpha Edison take home challenges, one of which is about Data collection, and the other of which is about Sentiment Analysis for IMDB Reviews. 

 

## Data collection:

On the website https://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/abdominal-disorders-3321, collect/scrape data on the most recent 20 posts and replies.  Design your preferred data structure to contain data on both post and replies, which must include:

Post or reply text

The Writer of the post or the Responder to Writer of a reply

The datetime of the post/reply in the form 2019-03-20T18:17+00:00
 
 
 
## NLP:
 
Download the data set at http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.  Using the 25K labeled training data, created a supervised sentiment classifier to classify the reviews as positive or negative.  Test on the data under the test directory and describe the level of accuracy you were able to achieve.
